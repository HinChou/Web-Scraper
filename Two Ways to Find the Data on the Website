The common reason Why we need the "Web Scraping" is data gathering. But instead of start digging into it, it's important to 
take a deep breath and think of alternatives. 



As the paragraph mentioned in the "Before Digging into Web Scraping", it is common and possible to find a text based html, 
which is even more convenient than parsing a well-formatted orginal html. 
For this, a common method is using "inspect" option in the browser like Chrome, to find those text based html or data based html.


In sum: 

1st, try to find the pure data page using "inspect" option in the browser like Chrome.

2nd, try to parse the useful data by analyzing the html structure of the webpage, 
which can be done by using beautifulsoap module in Python.
