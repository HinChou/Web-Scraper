# Web-Scraper

1. Tennis Data:
Las Vegas Opening and Closing Line of Tennis from Donbest.com

2. MLB Data:
Pitcher and batter matchup data from mlb.com

2. Houses for Rent Data:
Houses for rent data from http://www.58.com

4. Teacher Employment Information Data: 
Using multiprocessing module to aggregate information from several websites

Why multiprocessing? Differences between multiprocessing and threading.

# Thoughts:
* DataFrame & Series object have a nice feature about handling the missing data than list, array, dict.
* Exception handlings are important in web scraping.
* For avoiding blocking by servers (hit limits), try to include a sleep time of web crawler and fake dynamic ip.
