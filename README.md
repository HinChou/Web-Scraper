# Web-Scraper

1. Web Scraper for Tennis:
Las Vegas Opening and Closing Line of Tennis from Donbest.com

2. Web Scraper for MLB:
Pitcher and batter matchup data from mlb.com

# Thoughts:
* DataFrame & Series object have a nice feature about handling the missing data than list, array, dict.
* Exception handlings are important in web scraping.
* For avoiding blocking by servers (hit limits), try to include sleep time of web crawler and fake ip.
