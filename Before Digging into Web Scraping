You Don’t Always Need a Hammer: 

• Look for a “print this page” link, or perhaps a mobile version of the site that has better-formatted HTML 

• Look for the information hidden in a JavaScript file. Remember, you might need to examine the imported JavaScript files 
in order to do this. For example, I once collected street addresses (along with latitude and longitude) off a website in a
neatly formatted array by looking at the JavaScript for the embedded Google Map that displayed a pinpoint over each address.

• This is more common for page titles, but the information might be available in the URL of the page itself.

• If the information you are looking for is unique to this website for some reason, you’re out of luck. If not, 
try to think of other sources you could get this information from. Is there another website with the same data? 
Is this website displaying data that it scraped or aggregated from another website?
